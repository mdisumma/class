1. Visibilty of system status: 
    How well the product convays and keeps the user informed about what is (currently)going on.

2.  Match between system and the real world:
    Use words and phrases that are appropriate for the user and ones they are likely to understand(users familiar terminology). 

3.  User Control and Freedom:
    Give users a clear way back when they explore your website(back, undo and cancel options).

4.  Consistency and Standards:
     Follow platform and industry conventions. Users experience with other products set their expectations. 

5.  Error Prevention
    Design needs to try to prevent as many errors as possible, an example: present users with a confirmation option before they commit to an action.

6.  Recognition
    User should not have to remember information. You must try to reduce cognitive effort.

7.  Flexability and Efficiency
    Shortcuts may help experienced users interact with your product more effieciently.    
    
8.  Aesthetic designs
   Anything displayed on your product should be relevant, otherwise it competes for attention with the relevant infromation.
    
17. Error recovery
    To help users understand what errors have been made, do so in words and not via codes. Also, make the error message noticable and recognisable.

18. Help and Documentation
    May need some documentation to help users understand how to complete tasks.
